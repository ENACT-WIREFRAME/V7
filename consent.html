							<p>You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.</p>
							    <h3>What is the purpose of the study?</h3>
							<p>
							    National clinical audits play key roles in monitoring and improving the quality of patient care.  Feedback from these audits can help professionals and healthcare organisations identify and address areas for improvement.  There is evidence that the content and format of feedback can influence how professionals and organisations respond (e.g. use of comparators or graphics).  However, there are many possible ways to present feedback and an incomplete evidence base to guide best practice by national audit programmes.
							</p>
							<p>We are audit and feedback researchers working in partnership with people responsible for designing and delivering national audits. We plan to test different ways to improve the impact of national audits.</p>
							<p>This study involves inviting 500 clinicians and managers from across the UK to take part in a ‘virtual laboratory’ experiment. We will randomly assign people (using the play of chance) to see different ways of giving feedback on a website. They will then complete an online survey so that we can measure effects on plans to act on feedback, their understanding of feedback, ease of use and preferences – as well as how long they spend looking at the feedback.</p>
							<p>The findings from this study will then inform a later ‘real world’ study examining how different healthcare organisations respond and act on feedback from national audits.</p>
							<h3>Why have I been chosen?</h3>
							<p>You have been chosen because you are on the list of people who receive feedback reports from one of our collaborating national audit programmes.  Whether you play a relatively big or small part in receiving and responding to such feedback reports, we are still interested in your responses.</p>
							<h3>Do I have to take part?</h3>
							<p> It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide, you will be asked to give your consent.  You can still withdraw at any time without it affecting you (including any relationship you have with national audit programmes).  You do not have to give a reason.</p>
							<h3>What will happen to me if I take part?</h3>
							<p>If you wish to take part, please click the boxes in the online consent form.  If you consent, you will be asked some basic information about your role and then be shown a page with examples of national audit feedback.  Whilst the feedback we will show you is hypothetical, it is based upon recent and real audit data.  We will then ask you some questions to assess your reactions to the feedback.  We will finally ask for your name and contact information but only if you wish to receive a £25 voucher and certificate of completion for your continuing professional development records.  We anticipate that the survey will take no longer than 15 to 20 minutes].  You will not be asked to do anything else after this.  Once you have submitted your responses to the survey, you will not be able to withdraw your data.</p>
							<h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
							<p> Apart from the voucher and certificate, we hope that you will find participation interesting and thought-provoking.  After you have submitted your responses, we will give you the option of reading some brief evidence-based tips for improving the impact of feedback from audits.</p>
							<h3>What are the possible risks of taking part?</h3>
							<p>We anticipate no direct risks of participation, other than time and inconvenience.</p>
							<h3>Will the information I provide be treated confidentially?</h3>
							<p>Yes, all information provided will be confidential and held securely at the University of Leeds and City, University of London. Any information that could identify individuals will be removed from the interview transcript. Direct quotes may be included in reports arising from this work, but they will be anonymised and no individual will be identifiable. The data collected may be used in relevant future research in an anonymised form. Other genuine researchers will have access to this data only if they agree to preserve confidentiality.</p>
							<h3>What will happen to the results of this study?</h3>
							<p>As well as writing up our research findings for journal publication, we will also share key findings with national audit programmes in the UK and internationally. It will not be possible to identify you from any reports about the project.</p>
							<h3>Who is organising this study?</h3>
							<p>Our team comprises experienced researchers from the UK (University of Leeds, City, University of London, and University of Manchester) and Canada as well as collaborators from national audit programmes.  The chief investigator is Robbie Foy, a general practitioner and Professor of Primary Care at the University of Leeds.</p>
							<h3>Who is funding this study?</h3>
							<p>This study has been funded by the Health Services and Delivery Research Programme of the National Institute for Health Research (Project Number 16/04/13).</p>
							<h3>Who has reviewed the study?</h3>
							<p>This study has been reviewed and given a favourable opinion by the School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee at the University of Leeds (MREC16-180).</p>
							<h3>What if I need further information?</h3>
							<p>Please contact Tom Willis, our senior research fellow, (<a href="mailto:t.a.willis@leeds.ac.uk">t.a.willis@leeds.ac.uk</a>; 0113 343 7119).  Alternatively, if you have any concerns about this research, please contact Professor Suzanne Richards (<a href="mailto:s.h.richards@leeds.ac.uk">s.h.richards@leeds.ac.uk</a>; 0113 343 9815) who is independent of the research team.</p>
