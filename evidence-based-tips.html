	  	<h1>Evidence-based tips for effective feedback</h1>
		<p>Clinical audit with feedback can be an effective way of improving the quality of healthcare.  A Cochrane review of 140 randomised trials found that audit and feedback improved adherence to recommended processes of care by over 4% [1].  That might sound like a modest effect but can be important when it is applied across whole healthcare systems or patient populations.  However, the review also found that effects varied a lot between different trials.  One quarter of audit and feedback interventions had a relatively large, positive effect on quality of care, while another quarter had a negative or no effect.  Larger effects were present when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Baseline performance is low</li>
			<li>Feedback is delivered via a supervisor or colleague</li>
			<li>Feedback is provided more than once</li>
			<li>Feedback is delivered in both verbal and written formats</li>
			<li>Feedback includes both explicit targets and an action plan.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A more recent paper drew on expert interviews and evidence synthesis to derive 15 state-of-the-science recommendations for effective feedback [2].  These recommendations concern: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The nature of the desired action, e.g. improving the specificity of recommendations for action;</li>
			<li>The nature of the data available for feedback, e.g. providing more rapid or multiple feedback;</li>
			<li>Feedback display, e.g. minimising unnecessary cognitive workload for recipients;</li>
			<li>Delivery of feedback, e.g. addressing credibility of information.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These are all practical issues that can be taken into account when developing audit criteria and designing feedback â€“ and hence maximise the impact of audit programmes.</p>
